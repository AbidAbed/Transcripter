Welcome to Englobe's Media Channels. In this video, we will

2
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:07,370
explore the meaning of the English word unite.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,874
Unite means to come or bring together for a common purpose

4
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:14,426
or action. Example the two companies decided

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:18,506
to unite their resources and expertise to develop a new product that neither

6
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:21,994
could have accomplished alone. In the next clip,

7
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:25,040
we will see two people unite to fight a large group.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,120
Um,

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,480
I tell you, we ain't gonna want to be here when this thing goes off.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,886
Slushy's 400 yards through the slide. They hold her in

11
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:40,214
some sort of medical timer set for 45 minutes. We get in and get

12
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:43,590
out. Blow this death. Fight for the pieces. Remember the hallway.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,938
No guns. Right. Those guys have to be alive, because at the

14
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:49,954
end of the hallway, the retinal scanner needs a match to open the door.

15
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:53,614
Pick a door. All right, then. No, that's my door. It's better

16
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,480
with you.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,122
I made a mistake. This is your door. Oh, no. No backseat.

18
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,246
What's the matter? You got a lot of bad guys behind that door? What's this?

19
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:08,720
You want to learn something?

20
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,120
Corresponding match. Access. Did I

21
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,814
access? Deny access

22
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:53,100
did.
