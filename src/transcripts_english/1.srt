Welcome to englobes Media Channels. In this video, we will explore the

2
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:07,390
meaning of the English phrase blow up.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,066
Blow up means to explode or to cause something to explode,

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,374
often resulting in destruction or damage. Example the

5
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:18,270
terrorists planned to blow up the building with a bomb.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,480
In the next clip, we will see an angry bird who used to blow up.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,374
Now, bomb started with us two weeks ago.

8
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,790
Tell us your story, Bomb.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,690
Okay, well, sometimes when I get upset,

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,754
I have been known to blow

11
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:40,218
up. So like what? Like you get mad, you mean?

12
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:44,566
Well, no, I literally blow up, okay? I explode

13
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,010
like a bomb.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,190
Hence the name survive.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,230
Excuse me? Party foul.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,190
Do it. No can do. I just went boom boom before class.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,606
Hey, look, I don't want to be here at all, but this could maybe make

18
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,538
it a little more interesting to me. So please? It explode.

19
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:19,350
You can't do it, can you? Yes, I can. But I'm having back

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,680
issues today, so I'm going to have to take a rain check.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,722
Do it. Not the timer. Place the amigo. These guys are all nuts.

22
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,640
Big man.

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,766
Are we speaking telepathically or you're just good

24
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:35,860
talk.
